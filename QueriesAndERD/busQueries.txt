1. What query would you run to get the total revenue for March of 2012?
select monthname(charged_datetime) as month, sum(amount) as revenue from billing
where month(charged_datetime) = 3 and year(charged_datetime) = 2012
group by month

2. What query would you run to get total revenue collected from the client with an id of 2?
select clients.client_id, sum(amount) as total_revenue 
from billing join clients on billing.client_id = clients.client_id
where clients.client_id = 2

3. What query would you run to get all the sites that client=10 owns?
select clients.client_id, concat(clients.first_name, " ", clients.last_name) as client, sites.domain_name
from clients join sites on sites.client_id = clients.client_id
where clients.client_id = 10

4. What query would you run to get total # of sites created per month per year for the client with an id of 1? What about for client=20?d
select clients.client_id, concat(clients.first_name, " ", clients.last_name), count(sites.domain_name) as number_of_sites, monthname(sites.created_datetime) as month_created, year(sites.created_datetime) as year_created
from clients join sites on clients.client_id = sites.client_id
where clients.client_id = 1 or clients.client_id = 20
group by clients.client_id, month_created, year_created
order by sites.created_datetime

5. What query would you run to get the total # of leads generated for each of the sites between 
January 1, 2011 to February 15, 2011?
select sites.site_id, sites.domain_name, count(leads.leads_id) as total_leads
from sites join leads on sites.site_id = leads.site_id
where leads.registered_datetime between '2011-01-01' and '2011-02-15'
group by sites.site_id

6. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011?
select clients.first_name, clients.last_name, count(leads.leads_id) as number_of_leads
from clients join sites on sites.client_id = clients.client_id join leads on sites.site_id = leads.site_id
where leads.registered_datetime between '20112-01-01' and '2011-12-31'
group by clients.client_id

7. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each client each month between months 1 - 6 of Year 2011?
select concat(clients.first_name, " ", clients.last_name) as client, count(leads.leads_id) as number_of_leads, monthname(leads.registered_datetime) as month_generated
from clients join sites on sites.client_id = clients.client_id join leads on sites.site_id = leads.site_id
where leads.registered_datetime between '2011-01-01 00:00:00' and '2011-06-31 00:00:00'
group by clients.client_id, month_generated
order by leads.registered_datetime asc

8. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients' sites between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011? Order this query by client id.  Come up with a second query that shows all the clients, the site name(s), and the total number of leads generated from each site for all time.
A. select concat(clients.first_name, " ", clients.last_name) as client, sites.domain_name, count(leads.leads_id) as total_leads
from clients join sites on sites.client_id = clients.client_id join leads on sites.site_id = leads.site_id
where leads.registered_datetime between '2011-01-01' and '2011-12-31'
group by sites.site_id
order by clients.client_id

B. select concat(clients.first_name, " ", clients.last_name) as client, sites.domain_name, count(leads.leads_id) as total_leads
from clients join sites on sites.client_id = clients.client_id join leads on sites.site_id = leads.site_id
group by sites.site_id
order by clients.client_id

9. Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client for each month of the year. Order it by client id.
select clients.client_id, concat(clients.first_name, " ", clients.last_name) as client, sum(billing.amount), monthname(billing.charged_datetime) as month, year(billing.charged_datetime) as year
from clients join billing on clients.client_id = billing.client_id
group by clients.client_id, month(billing.charged_datetime)
order by clients.client_id, billing.charged_datetime

10. Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns. Group the results so that each row shows a new client. It will become clearer when you add a new field called 'sites' that has all the sites that the client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)
select concat(clients.first_name, " ", clients.last_name) as client, group_concat(sites.domain_name)
from clients join sites on clients.client_id = sites.site_id
group by clients.client_id
order by clients.client_id;
